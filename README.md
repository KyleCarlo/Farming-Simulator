# About

Farming Simulator is a simulation game designed to immerse players in the challenges and rewards of managing their own virtual farm. Players are tasked with planting, growing, and harvesting crops while making strategic decisions about resource allocation and market interactions. The game showcases principles of object-oriented programming and modular software design, making it both an engaging gaming experience and an educational project.

Key objectives of the project include:

- Providing an interactive way to learn resource management and decision-making.
- Demonstrating clean code practices and modular architecture.
- Offering a scalable framework for expanding gameplay features.

# Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `Control/`: Contains the game logic and controller classes.
- `Model/`: Houses data models representing game entities (e.g., crops, resources).
- `View/`: Includes the user interface components for rendering the game (text or graphical).
- `resources/`: Stores assets such as images, audio files, or configuration data.

# Features

- **Dynamic Crop Growth**: Simulates the growth stages of crops based on time and resources.
- **Resource Management**: Manage water, fertilizer, and seeds to maximize yields.
- **Harvesting System**: Interactive gameplay for harvesting crops at the right time.
- **Economy Module**: Buy and sell resources or crops in a simulated market.
- **Expandable Architecture**: Designed to easily integrate new features or modifications.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive controls and visuals for an engaging player experience.
